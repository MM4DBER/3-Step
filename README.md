# 3-Step-ML-auto

> This `R` tutorial automates the 3-step ML axiliary variable procedure using the `MplusAutomation` package (Hallquist & Wiley, 2018) to estimate models and extract relevant parameters. To learn more about auxiliary variable integration methods and why multi-step methods are necessary for producing un-biased estimates see Asparouhov & MuthÃ©n (2014). 

> The motivation for writing this tutorial is that conducting the 3-step manually is highly error prone as it requires pulling logit values estimated in the step-1 model and adding them in the model statement of the step-2 model (i.e., lots of copying & pasting). In contrast, this approach is fully replicable and provides clear documentation which translates to more reliable research.
